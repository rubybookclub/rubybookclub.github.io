Welcome. This is a website for the Ruby Junior developer bookclub. 
Started at the start of 2025, we are currently covering Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen. 

Incase you're interested in joining, kindly email me at rubybookclub@gmail.com and I'll add you to the discord group.

For the new members as well as those that want to catch up, for every chapter we cover, a summary is available on this website. You can go through it as you desire. We'd be glad to have you join us!

Or even better, kindly get a copy of the book and go through the previously covered chapters. 

Our Roadmap documents the dates on which every chapter is scheduled to be covered. 
Incase of any inquiries, I'm always a DM away on Twitter/X @zhephyn or at rubybookclub@gmail.com
